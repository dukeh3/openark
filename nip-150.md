## OpenARK Templates

These templates define the structure for HTLC operations within the OpenARK protocol. Templates are referenced via tags in `vtxo_spend_request` messages.

### HTLC_Offer

Used when proposing an HTLC payment. The sender creates a conditional output that can be claimed by the recipient if they reveal the preimage.

**Parameters:**
- `hash`: The hash H(P) that locks the funds
- `amount`: The amount in satoshis being offered
- `timeout_block`: Block height after which the offer expires
- `sender_pubkey`: Public key of the HTLC creator
- `recipient_pubkey`: Public key of the intended recipient

**Output Conditions:**
1. **Success Path**: Recipient can claim with signature + preimage P where H(P) matches hash
2. **Timeout Path**: Sender can reclaim after timeout_block with signature

### HTLC_Success

Used when claiming an HTLC by revealing the preimage. This template references a prior HTLC_Offer and provides the preimage to unlock funds.

**Parameters:**
- `htlc_offer_id`: Reference to the original HTLC_Offer transaction
- `preimage`: The secret P such that H(P) matches the offer's hash
- `recipient_pubkey`: Public key claiming the funds

**Requirements:**
- Must reference a valid, unexpired HTLC_Offer
- Preimage must hash to the HTLC_Offer's hash value
- Must be signed by the recipient

### HTLC_Timeout

Used when reclaiming funds from an expired HTLC. The original sender can recover their funds after the timeout block has been mined.

**Parameters:**
- `htlc_offer_id`: Reference to the original HTLC_Offer transaction
- `sender_pubkey`: Public key reclaiming the funds

**Requirements:**
- Must reference a valid HTLC_Offer
- Current block height must be >= timeout_block from the offer
- Must be signed by the original sender
- HTLC must not have been claimed via HTLC_Success

## Message format

## Transaction messages

### vtxo_spend_request
Issued by the User who wishes to create a new transaction.
content: Base64-encoded PSBT, including signatures for incoming transactions.


    1. Tags all the outputs that are spent.
    2. Tags all the transactions that are spent.
    3. Tags all the signers that are requested to contribute.
    4. Tags all the potential beneficiaries. 
    5. Tags the template


### vtxo_spend_confirmed

nostr_id: 1502
content: Base64-encoded PSBT, including the additional signature this party provides.

Issued by co-signers who need to contribute to the transaction.

### vtxo_spend_complete

nostr_id: 1503
content: Base64-encoded final transaction.

Issued by the Ark Service Provider, contains the new transaction.

    1. Tags the txid of the new transaction.
    2. Tags to vtxo_spend_request.

### vtxo_spend_recall_request
nostr_id: 1504
Issued by a requester to cancel a previously submitted vtxo_spend_request.

### vtxo_spend_recalled
nostr_id: 1505
Issued by the Ark Service Provider, confirming that the vtxo_spend_request is to be considered recalled, and will never be completed.

    1. Tags to vtxo_spend_request.

### Code for Ark Service Provider

Only reactive, when you are tagged in a vtxo_spend_request you subscribe to the thread. You check if the current thread has enough information to complete the transaction. IE, you go over all of the inputs that are being spent and check:
1. Verify that the input is open for spending.
2. Check that all the signatures and other attributes are there.

If so, then you complete it, this means mark all the inputs as spent. Then send out the complete message and then unsubscribe from the thread.

If a recall request is received, mark the request as recalled. Issue a vtxo_spend_recalled, and unsubscribe from the thread.
